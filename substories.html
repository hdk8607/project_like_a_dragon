                        <p>Whether you play either as Majima or Kiryu, both characters have lots of content 
                        besides the main story. Both characters are pretty much shenanigans magnets, to say the least.
                        No matter where they go, they either get into a street fight, or they drop everything to help some of the most 
                        random or stupid (not exaggerating) people in their respective towns. However, whether its bowling, darts, pool, or even karaoke, 
                        Yakuza 0 has some pretty big minigames and management. In this example, Kiryu temporarily has a real estate business 
                        minigame where you collect money, invest to collect more money, or spend on getting more buildings to invest, with some 
                        "friendly" rivalry along the way.</p>

                    <h2>Even more side content</h2>
                    <img width="600px" src="images/cabaret.jpg" alt="Sunshine Cabaret" class="image_2">
                    <p>As mentioned before, there are plenty of ways to enjoy Yakuza 0. In more detail, there are plenty of shops and 
                    people to meet. For example, Kiryu can meet Pocket Circuit Fighter, who manages the local pocket circuit business. 
                    And not only that you can participate in that kids game too. Karaoke: sing your heart out. Fishing: go to the local harbor or river and go ahead. 
                    And don't worry, Majima can also do this stuff to (minus pocker circuit, sadly). In this other example, Majima temporarily manages 
                    a cabaret club, not to be mistaken for a cabaret like the Grand. In this, you assign girls to tables, hire more girls, and dress up the 
                    premium rarity girls.</p>
